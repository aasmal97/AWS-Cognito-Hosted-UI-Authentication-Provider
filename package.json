  "description": "A dependency-free client-facing sdk, that wraps api calls to aws-cognito's hosted ui auth server, and handles oauth 2 authentication by refreshing access tokens, storing credentials locally, revoking sessions and tokens, and navigating to the  hosted ui for a new authorization code, when tokens or sessions have expired. Can be used for both server-side and client-side apps, although client-side apps may require extra-setup.",
